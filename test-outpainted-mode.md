# OutPainted Mode Implementation Test

## Changes Made

I've successfully added the 4th mode "OutPainted" to the ImageNode component. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. Updated Toolbar Mode Type
- Added `'outpainted'` to the toolbar mode type definition
- Now supports: `'default' | 'inpainting' | 'outpainting' | 'outpainted'`

### 2. Updated Selection Logic
The main selection effect now handles all 4 modes:

**When Selected:**
- If connected to inpainting node → `inpainting` mode
- If connected to outpainting node → `outpainting` mode  
- Otherwise → `default` mode

**When Unselected:**
- If connected to outpainting node → `outpainted` mode (NEW!)
- Otherwise → `default` mode

### 3. OutPainted Mode Behavior
The `outpainted` mode:
- ✅ Has the same visual appearance as `outpainting` mode (padding, aspect ratio adjustment)
- ✅ Has NO NodeToolbar (toolbar only shows when `selected && toolbarMode !== 'outpainted'`)
- ✅ Has NO padding draggers (only show when `selected && toolbarMode === 'outpainting'`)
- ✅ Automatically activates when node is unselected while connected to outpaint node

### 4. Close Button Behavior
- When clicking "X" in outpainting mode, it now unselects the node
- This automatically triggers the transition to `outpainted` mode (NOT default mode)
- Does NOT set `userClosedOutpainting` to true (this was the bug)
- Uses `setSelectedNode(null)` from the canvas store

### 5. Visual Styling
- **OutPaint and OutPainted modes**: 
  - Use inset drop shadow border (`box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px #3b82f6`) for proper positioning
  - Background image with 10px blur and 10% opacity in the padding area
  - Creates a visual "outer border" effect with blurred image background
- **Other modes**: Use regular blue border when selected

### 6. Padding System (NEW!)
- **Percentage-based**: Padding values are now stored and displayed as percentages
- **Responsive**: 100% left/right padding = full width, 100% top/bottom padding = full height
- **UX improvement**: More intuitive than pixel values
- **Right sidebar**: Shows percentage values with "%" suffix

### 7. Drag Behavior (NEW!)
- **Selection lock**: Node stays selected while dragging padding draggers
- **Delayed unlock**: Normal selection behavior resumes 2ms after drag ends
- **Prevents accidental deselection**: No more losing selection when dragging near canvas edge

### 8. Dimension Management
- Both `outpainting` and `outpainted` modes use the same dimension logic
- Aspect ratio adjustment works in both modes
- Original dimensions are preserved and restored correctly

## Testing Instructions

To test the implementation:

1. **Create an image node** and connect it to an outpainting node
2. **Select the image node** - should show "OutPaint Mode" toolbar with padding draggers
3. **Test padding draggers**:
   - Drag any padding dragger - node should remain selected during dragging
   - Node should only become deselectable 2ms after dragging stops
   - Padding values should display as percentages (e.g., 100% = full width/height)
4. **Click the "X" button** - node should become unselected and enter outpainted mode (NOT default mode)
5. **Verify outpainted mode**:
   - No toolbar should be visible
   - No padding draggers should be visible  
   - Visual appearance should remain the same (padding, aspect ratio)
   - Should have drop shadow border
   - Should have blurred background image in padding area (5px blur, 10% opacity)
   - Right sidebar should still show padding controls with percentage values
6. **Disconnect the outpaint node** - should return to default mode
7. **Reconnect and select again** - should return to outpainting mode

## Key Files Modified

- `src/components/nodes/ImageNode.tsx` - Main implementation
- The RightSidebar doesn't need changes as it already handles outpainting connections properly

## Expected Behavior Flow

```
Default Mode (unselected, no outpaint connection)
    ↓ (connect outpaint node)
OutPainted Mode (unselected, has outpaint connection) 
    ↓ (select node)
OutPaint Mode (selected, has outpaint connection)
    ↓ (click X button)
OutPainted Mode (unselected, has outpaint connection)
    ↓ (disconnect outpaint node)
Default Mode (unselected, no outpaint connection)
```

The implementation prevents going directly from outpainted mode to default mode unless the outpaint node is disconnected, as requested.
