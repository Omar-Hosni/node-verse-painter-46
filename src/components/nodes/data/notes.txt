upon selecting templates
it shows choices of the ready templates of that control net
example: ready poses

source it will be preprocessed
final map means it is already processed

map: to insert the preprocessed output to the canvas

segment and normal map is deprecated so remove it from left sidebar

reference: face, stlyle, object (coming soon)

re-imagine, it takes an image and just re-denoisining

rescene, takes 2 images (scene, object)
upon connection decide what is the scene and what is the object
its literally a reference node that takes 2 images
the way it works in backend is as follows


reangle coming soon

removebg, 
compare will be a node that has a slider that shows the comparison
between the mask and the original image
deliver is if you're generating an image or a mask

upsacle, style is doing nothing for now until further notice
compare will be a slider to show difference between 
original image and upscaled

inpainting, we need to be able to draw the mask image
could be soon and not in MVP

3d not doable now

merger, its just using the IPadapter of multiple medias in runware

router, 

image output will be either card shaped or image layer shaped

seed better be same for engines

gears uses tags which are trigger words, it activates 
certain styles that lora is trained on

conditional rules
1-no controller can join to engine with a re-rendering
2-no tools can join to engine with re-rendering
3-only one re-rendering allowed
4-only one tools nodes allowed
5-engine node can not connect to something unless it has a from connection
6-re-imagine, in-painting, out-painting can only be used if they have a from connection of engine




1-the image output and realtime preview are similar in design as image layer, but instead they act as output nodes for the generation, so when user selects imageoutput node on canvas, the rightsidebar is expected to show generate button that takes the workflow nodes' functionality from data and sends it to runware api to generate the image

2-fix the connection rules because i currently can't connect any shit to each other. the from array is nodes you can connect from(left handle) and to array is nodes you can connect to(right handle)

3-there is also global rules in node_schema.ts that ensure a workflow or node has some certain data/elements before a connection is allowed

4-the workflow needs to be extractable for runware api, the current nodes plays different functionalities (lora, controlnets, models), make sure the generate image extracts functionalities of workflow nodes to generate output in the image-output preview layer node.
