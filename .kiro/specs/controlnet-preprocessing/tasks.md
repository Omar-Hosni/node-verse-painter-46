# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create ControlNet preprocessor mapping and utilities

  - Define the mapping between ControlNet node types and their corresponding preprocessors
  - Create utility functions to get preprocessor names from node types
  - Add TypeScript interfaces for preprocessed image data
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7_

- [x] 2. Extend Runware service with ControlNet preprocessing methods

  - Add preprocessForControlNet method that wraps the existing preprocessImage functionality

  - Add preprocessForControlNet method that wraps the existing preprocessImage functionality
  - Implement getPreprocessorForControlNet utility method
  - Add error handling specific to ControlNet preprocessing scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Enhance node data structures for preprocessed image storage

  - Extend ControlNet node data interface to include preprocessed image information
  - Add isPreprocessing flag to track preprocessing state
  - Update node creation and data management to handle new fields
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

-

- [x] 4. Implement connection event detection and handling

  - Create connection handler that detects image-to-ControlNet connections
  - Add logic to identify when preprocessing should be triggered
  - Implement connection removal handling to clear preprocessed data
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 5.4_

- [x] 5. Create preprocessing trigger logic

  - Implement automatic preprocessing when image connects to ControlNet node
  - Add validation to ensure source node has valid image data
  - Handle the light ControlNet node exception (no preprocessing)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.7_

- [ ] 6. Add preprocessing state management

  - Implement loading states during preprocessing operations

  - Add error state handling for failed preprocessing
  - Create state updates for successful preprocessing completion
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 1.4_

- [x] 7. Update sidebar display logic for preprocessed images

  - Modify RiveInput component to detect ControlNet nodes with preprocessed data
  - Replace Rive animation with preprocessed image display when available
  - Add loading indicator during preprocessing operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.2_

- [x] 8. Implement data persistence for preprocessed results

  - Ensure preprocessed data is saved with workflow state
  - Add loading of preprocessed data when workflow is restored
  - Implement cleanup of preprocessed data when connections are removed
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 9. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback


- [ ] 9. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

  - Implement retry logic for failed preprocessing operations
  - Add user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios
  - Create fallback behavior when preprocessing fails
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.3_
-

- [x] 10. Add performance optimizations and caching




  - Implement caching to avoid redundant preprocessing of same images
  - Add debouncing for rapid connection changes
  - Optimize memory usage for stored preprocessed images
  - _Requirements: 4.4_
